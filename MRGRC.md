# Math Rocks Gameplay Refference Doc (MRGRC)

# Version 0.1

    **Introduction** - the Math Rocks ttrpg is first and formost, merely a vehicle for a goup of people to engage in a collaborative role play experience.  It is a set of guidelines.  Nothing in this document is a hard rule, and groups are encuraged to change and modify this document to fit their unique playstyles.  In fact, the main goal of the system is to be modular and extendable, with lots of optional components.  In this way we try not to enforce or assume any particular genre.  That is to say, math rocks is not any more a system for a high fantasy spells and magic adventure, than it is a system for a space opera sci fi galavant.  The system is designed to be open, simple, and accessable with terms that make sense, and are clear.

- **Players -** Players are everyone who participates in the collaborative story telling of a Math Rocks TTRPG session aside from the GM(see Game Master section below)  Players are primarrilly responsible for playing Player Charachters in the game.  This **DOES NOT** mean they are unable to contribute other factors to the game such as additional non player charachters (npcs), world building elements, or even assisting the other players or GM.  In fact, doing so is encuraged.  Players **ARE** responsible for respecting eachother.  This means respecting other participant's time, creations, contributions, limitations, and efforts.

- **Game Master(GM) –** It is the GM’s responsibility to resolve **in game** conflicts and often create or choose the basic framework of the world.  This **DOES NOT** mean only the GM is responsible for these elements, far from it.  Players are encuraged to participate in the world building, particularly in creating backstories of their charachters and figuring out how their charachters fit into the world that everyone is helping to create.  This does not mean players can do what ever they want however.  In order to bring some semblence of order and cohesion to the game, the GM is ultimately resposible for what happens, what rules are used, how the game functions, and resolving any in game conflicts.  Essentially, the GMs job is to make sure to faccilitate that the game runs smoothly and in order to facilitate that, the GM's word is law.  If the GM says "Rocks fall, everybody dies" it happens.  If the GM says, "All your abilities are gone and you are now a pot of petunias in free fall with a whale" it happens.  Do not argue with the GM durring a session once they have made a rulling unless absolutely essntial, and if they tell you it happens anyway, once again, it happens.  It is best to bring things up to your GM after the session if you still feel something was unfair.  Due to the amount of power the GM has, they also have a responsibility to not abuse this power and to still try to faccilitate the wishes of the players where possible.   Finally if no resolution can be reached, it is often best to not play in that session if it makes you or others miserable.  Not every game is for every person.  Players are encuraged to find a GM who runs a game they enjoy to play in, or especially to create and run the kinds of games that they want to see as a GM.  GMing from time to time can also lend perspective to the players about just why GMs make certain calls that may otherwise feel unfair, or why you weren't allowed to use an ability the GM felt was overpowered.  That said, this topic is quite extensive, and this documents primary purose is to inform you of the systems and framework to run your own game, and further delving into the specifics of conflict resolution between players and GMs is beyond the scope of this document, but we hope the text provided is helpful when, eventually, such a situation does arise with some group playing ttrpgs(in this or other systems).

- **Math Rocks –** Math rocks are multi sided objects which can be thrown to generate random numbers. This is done by observing the markings visible on top of the math rocks which number the sides of the math rock which include all integer numbers in a range [1, n] or [0, n-1] where n is the number of signs. Math rocks uses a 1-based system, so if you have a 4 sided math rock with the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 it is understood that ‘0’ (Or any special value representing 0, as is sometimes seen on math rocks) is to be read as the max number of sides, in this case 4. Typically a ‘fair’ math rock has an equal chance of landing on any side when ossed/dropped which will indicate the random number generated. As math commonly called dice, many TTRPG communities have begun referring to math rocks by ‘d’ followed by the number of sides. This a standard 6 sided math rock is a d6, a 4 sided math rock is a d4, a 20 sided math rock is a d20, and so on. additionally, there may be special dice which must be used in combinations, such as using 2 d10s to roll 2 digits of a number 0-99 (1-100) where one math rock
   represents the ones place and the other represents the 10s place. These are sometimes collectively called a d100, but are more commonly refereed to as percentile math rocks as a d100 implies a math rock with 100 sides on a single rock.

- **Stats**
  
  Stats form the basic building blocks of your charachters power.  They determine your charachters natural capability in specific areas.  These are optionally associated with one of 7 colors.  A proposed set of stats is listed below:
  
  - Strength(str) - red: This stat represents a character's physical power and the ability to exert force. Characters with high strength may be able to lift heavy objects, hit harder in combat, or have an advantage in physical challenges.
  
  - Protection(Protec) - blue: This stat represents a character's ability to resist physical damage and protect themselves from harm. This includes the use of armor and other physical protections, which can help to reduce the amount of damage a character takes in combat or other physical challenges. Characters with high Protection may be able to withstand more hits in combat, or be less likely to be affected by certain types of attacks.
  
  - Endurance(end) - orange: This stat represents a character's physical stamina and the ability to withstand prolonged physical exertion. Characters with high endurance may be able to run longer distances, hold their breath longer, or have a higher resistance to fatigue.
  
  - Dexterity(dex) - green: This stat represents a character's agility, coordination, and precision. Characters with high dexterity may be more agile, have better hand-eye coordination, or have an advantage in tasks requiring fine motor skills.
  
  - Mind(mnd) - indigo: This stat represents a character's mental acuity, knowledge, perception, and problem-solving ability. Characters with high mind may have a better memory, be more perceptive, see through deception more easily, or have an advantage in tasks requiring mental quickness and creative problem-solving.
  
  - Piety(pie) - yellow: This stat represents a character's spiritual devotion and connection to a higher power. Characters with high piety may be more attuned to spiritual matters, have a stronger sense of morality, or be able to draw upon spiritual energy in certain situations.  Note that this higher power need not neccissarilly be strictly devine or spiritual in nature.  This may also be applicable to a patron, or  an artificial general intelligence, or even some collective conciousness.
  
  - presence(pres) - violet: This stat represents a character's charisma, charm, and ability to command attention. Characters with high presence may be more influential, have a stronger stage presence, or have an easier time persuading others.
  
  **Note ** that these are merely proposals and ultimatlely wheter or not to use these particular stats are left to the GMs descresion.  The GM and players may, as always, choose to add, remove, or modify stats as they best suit their play style.  Going forward the proposed stats will be referred to as the "standard stat block" and the optionally associated colors will be.  There are three standard ways of rolling stats.  
  
  - Commoner rolls: Roll 7d10. Place them into your stat block starting at the top and working down the list.
  
  - Adventurer rolls: Roll 7d8+2.  Place them into your stat block in any order you wish.
  
  - Heroic rolls: Roll 7d6+4.  Place them into your stat block in any order you wish.
  
  - Elite rolls: Roll 7d4+6.  Place them into your stat block in any order you wish.

- **Skills**
  
  Skills are techniques that utlize a charachter's natural capabilities(stats) to perform a generic action.  The standard skill block is as follows:
  
  - Acrobatics (dex)
  
  - Analysis (mind)
  
  - Coordination (dex)
  
  - Climbing (dex/str)
  
  - Deception (dex/pres)
  
  - Detection (mind)
  
  - Discretion (dex/pres)
  
  - Domination (str/mind/pres)
  
  - First Aid (mind)
  
  - Fishing (dex/mind)
  
  - Foraging (mind/endur)
  
  - Hunting (dex/pres)
  
  - Influence (pres)
  
  - Navigation (mind)
  
  - Physicality (str)
  
  - Resourcefulness (dex/mind)
  
  - Swimming (dex/str)
  
  - Tracking (mind)
  
  - Vigilance (mind/end)
  
  Eitehr a GM may call for a roll to dertermine the outcome of an action, or a player may ask to make a roll.  For instance if you want to try to lift something heavy, the GM may ask for a physicality check.  If you want to hide from a passerby, you may ask if you can roll Discretion.  Depending on how your charachter is going about the action, you may be allowed to utilize different base stats to execute the skill (you'll note that recomendations for the basic stats that power skills are listed after the skills)  The GM may disallow certain rolls, because the task is trivial(such as walking on flat easy terrain) and so it just works, or because no matter what you roll it would not be possible (for instance if your charachter is an ordinary commoner, and tough you have no way of doing so, you want to cause everyone in the campaign to spontaneously combust).  And in fact, even if a rule would otherwise allow something to occur, the GM has the ultimate authority on what cannonically happens in the campaign.  Note that this list of skills is once again, not exhaustive or manditory.  For instance, if you are in a desert and it will never be relevant to go fishing, you may remove the fishing skill from the system for your campaign.  You may also add stats such as "Magic", "Casting", or "hacking" if those are appropriate to your campain.  Additionally, you may utilize prewritten Math Rocks TTRPG modules.  Modules in the MRTTRPG do not add specific adventures.  That is left to the GM and the players to develop.  Rather, modules provides useful systems and presets that players may utilize to modify the MRTTRPG system.  Once again, we reitterate, our goal is not to cover every possible case, but to empower players and GMs to create and play whatever and however they wan to do so.  MRTTRPG is merely meant as a common starting point for others to customize to better suit their needs.

- **Abilities**
  
  Abilites are an optional component of the MRTTRPG system.  Abilities are minor additions or tweaks that change the rules of the game to grant new "abilities" to charachters.  Abbilities are always ACTIVE modifications, that is, a charachter must activate an ability, such as entering a stance, casting a spell, or consuming some resource for some mechanichal benifit.  Modules may add whole groups of abilities in a "Added Abilities List" (We know, that name is just so boring and to the point players may not have to spend hours of precious session time debating what and ability is and where to find it in modules) such as a spell compendium added abilities list, or a hacking playbook added abilities list.  But these are all simply added abilities lists at the end of the day.  Modules may also add resources such as Mana or Focus which needs to be expended to activate abilities.  Abilities may also only activate under certain conditions or prerequisite requirements.

- **Traits**
  
  Trats are passive affects that are applied to a charachter, party, or other entity.  Traits do not need to be activated, and no activation cost is required(this **DOES NOT** mean a trait can **NEVER** have a negative effect)  Some example of traits may be that a species moves twice as fast in water.  Or that a charachter can see in the dark as if the area was lit by daylight.  Or that a carachter can just jump 100ft vertically.  Trats may also only activate under certain conditions or prerequisite requirements. Again, the MRGRC does not specify any explicit traits.  Traits also come from modules.

- **HP -** HP or hit points is an optional component of the MRGRC that is a representation of how much damage you can take before you are removed from combat.  The MRGRC does not specify the details of this as we want to make the MRGRC as open and flexible as possible.  This may mean unconcious, this may mean dead, this may mean you need to sing a song about the person who slew you to resurrect and exact your revenge.  HP could even represent "social fatigue" in more roleplay heavy systems that do not feature *traditional* combat.  Or a module could add both a combat system and a social encounter system.  The MRGRC lists these only as examples and encurages player creativity.

- **Defense(def) -** Defence is another optional component of the MRGRC.  Def is often used to protect your HP.  As HP is optional, like many components of the MRGRC, def is also purely optional.  
  
  Many components here are listed as a basis, a stating point, essentially things that exist in the MRGRC are there here as optional components mostly to clarify terminology in games and modules that implement them, so we can be more clear about what HP is for instance, rather than calling them many different things such as hearts, life breaths, etc, etc... Of course, ultimately these may be changed and ommitted anyway at the module developer's discrestion and ultimately the GM.

- **Other systems**
  
  It is likely that many campains may require additional systems to function as intended.  Such as magic modules, or cyberpunk modules, or social encounter modules.  This is encuraged.  Take the MRGRC and build ontop of it, modify it, rip out bits you don't like.  Ultimately the MRGRC was created as guidance to help people start and run their own ttrpgs campaigns.
